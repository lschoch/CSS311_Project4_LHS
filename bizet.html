                    <H6 class="lines">Georges Bizet (1838-1875)</H6>
                    <p>The composer of the classic opera "Carmen" was born in 1838 near Paris. 
                        Bizet's first teacher was his father, a noted voice teacher and pianist. 
                        Later he studied at the Paris Conservatory, where one of his instructors 
                        was Gounod. At 19, Bizet won the prestigious Prix de Rome.
                        <br><br>
                        Bizet's first opera, "La Maison du Docteur," was written when he was only
                        14. He wrote "Le Docteur Miracle" in 1857, winning the Prix de Rome. This 
                        piece was later performed at the Bouffes-Parisiens. Bizet used the prize 
                        money from the award to subsidize his stay in Paris. From 1858 to 1860, 
                        Bizet started several operas, but managed to only finish one, "Don 
                        Procopio." This opera, written in 1859, was not put on stage until 1906. 
                        Lacking commercial success, Bizet made his living from teaching the 
                        piano, and as a accompanist for other people's work.
                        <br><br>
                        Yet, he still wrote. The 1863 opera, "Les P&ecirc;cheurs de Perles," takes place
                        in the Orient, and probably contains material from his earlier, unfinished
                        operas. The opera did not meet with either commercial or critical success. 
                        Hector Berlioz, who praised the opera, was one notable exception. 
                        Nevertheless, Bizet received a commission for another work, the 
                        five-act "Ivan IV" in 1865. Sadly, production on this opera had to be
                        abandoned after many delays and problems. "Ivan IV" had to wait until 1946
                        before being received on stage.
                        <br><br>
                        Other operas followed, by none of them were commercial or critical
                        successes. The production of "La Jolie Fille de Perth" was met with 
                        better reviews, but not commercial acclaim. The same was true of "Djamileh,"
                        written in 1871.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite his failures, Bizet was asked to write an opera based on 
                        Merimee's "Carmen." Controversy surrounded the piece because of its subject
                        matter. Bizet refused to water-down the material, despite the fear that
                        the opera would alienate the public. The public was alienated. The opera
                        closed after only 48 performances. Yet, a year after Bizet's death, the
                        piece was revived with a series of triumphant performances in Vienna.
                        "Carmen" is recognized as Bizet's masterpiece, and a classic.
                        <br><br>
                        Bizet died in 1875 at the age of 42.</p>
