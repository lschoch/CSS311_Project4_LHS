<p>I chose Bootstrap for several reasons: I find it visually appealing and have always been drawn to its flexibility. In addition, I have some experience with it and I wanted to advance my Bootstrap skills. Missing the opportunity to learn a new framework was partially compensated by the fact that Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle layouts, and I have no experience with flexbox.
