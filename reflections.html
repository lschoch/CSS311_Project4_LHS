<h4>Choice of Bootstrap</h4>
<p>I chose Bootstrap for several reasons: I find it visually appealing and have always been drawn to its flexibility. In addition, I have some prior experience with Bootstrap and want to advance my skills in its use. Missing the opportunity to learn a new framework is partially compensated by the fact that Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox to handle layouts, instead of floats, and I have no experience with flexbox.
