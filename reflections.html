                <p>I chose Bootstrap for several reasons: I find it visually appealing and have always been drawn to the range of options and flexibility it provides. In addition, I had some prior experience with Bootstrap and wanted to advance my skills in its use. Missing the opportunity to learn a new framework would be partially compensated by the fact that Bootstrap now uses flexbox to handle layouts, instead of floats, and I had no experience with flexbox.</p>

                <h5>Challenges and satisfactions - some randoms thoughts</h5>
            </div> <!-- end row3 -->
            <div id="row4" class="row">
                <div class="col">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Diving in: despite reading through the documentation for bootstrap and prior experience with this framework, I felt completely lost when I first started coding this project. Things quickly fell into place, however, and I now feel reasonably adept at using the flexbox approach to layout that is incorporated into Bootstrap. It is my hope that my final product confirms this conclusion.</li>
                        <li>Keeping track of rows and columns, and divs for same: the task of keeping track of rows and columns, and rows within columns, not to mention their associated divs, seemed daunting at first, but once again, a comfort level came relatively quickly. And after all, achieving such comfort levels is what these projects are all about.</li>
                        <li>Lookng up all the minutiae, such as the codes for all the diacritical characters in this particular project.</li>
                        <li>Likewise, all the copying and pasting to create the pages for the different composers was somewhat tedious and detracted from the more creative endeavors such as choosing placement, colors, borders, padding, etc. I'm not really complaining here as I realize and accept that these activities are a necessary part of the process and a satisfactory result would not be possible without them.</li>
                        <li>This project has left me feeling much more adept with css selectors, especially fine tuning them to tweak the appearance of my project.</li>
                        <li>It was fun suspecting and then confirming that rows within columns get their own allotment of 12 columns, or at least it seemed to work that way.</li>
                        <li>In addition to the satisfaction of creating this project, I appreciated learning the information provided about each of the composers. I have always been a fan of theater (though pandemic-deprived for the past 2+ years). This project has piqued my interest in opera and my bucket list now includes experiencing one of the classics, preferably at a reknowned venue such as La Scala in Milan (the Metropolitan Opera in New York will also suffice).</li>
